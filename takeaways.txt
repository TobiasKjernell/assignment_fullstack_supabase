npx supabase login //Logins to dashboard for the project.

npx supabase gen types --project-id djtrsbnmuzvpfgshvqyt > ./utils/supabase/database-types.ts
if you changing anything in database/tables, you'll have to update project types. 


//if we making a async call to supabase, we can create a return type for that call: 
import { QueryData } from '@supabase/supabase-js';  
export type HomePostsType = QueryData<ReturnType<typeof getHomePosts>>

server side rendering takes away alot of the snappy feeling on a webside. 
serverside setup with supabase is provided on their api site, how-to.
nextjs is no bueno with errors still existing, almost like they gave up on it.
-- have to make a website with Tanstack Smart just to try it out.

supabase really easy to get things going, very nice when database is needed for your own projects.
im still more into clientside websites but serverside/hybrid is needed for e-comms sites.
